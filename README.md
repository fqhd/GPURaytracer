# GPURaytracer
A raytracer that I coded when i was working on my image denoising AI, I coded it primarily to generate pairs of noisy and denoised raytraced images to train the model. The bulk of the raytracing code can be found inside the shaders folder in the `gl.fs` file. This is the fragment shader that is run for every pixel of the generated image and generates a color for it. The program depends on `GLFW` and `glm` that are not included within the project because of their size. There are a couple other dependencies(`GLAD` and `stb_image_write`) but they are included within the project so you don't have to worry about linking to them.
